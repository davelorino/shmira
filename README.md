A project management tool.

This is just a way for me to make something that I can actually benefit from using.

I think two things will determine whether this was successful:

1. Does this make it easier to manage and track my projects?
2. Is the experience of using this more enjoyable than just using a notepad?

I think its possible to achieve one and not both goals, however I think that both are essential requirements in order to call this a win. We'll see.
